          AI and its ethical issues is of significance for governments, industry, the general public, and academia, all of whom (sometimes from very different perspectives) recognize the importance of ethical guidelines and requirements in the AI domain. 
          The workshop is of interest to a broad audience, including researchers, practitioners, and experts, who are invested in the ethical and moral dimensions of AI, knowledge graphs, and generative AI systems. This includes individuals and organizations from various fields, such as Computer Science, Semantic Web, Cognitive Science, Ethics, and Cultural Studies, who share an interest in responsible AI development and the alignment of AI technologies with human values and societal ethics.
          This workshop accepts contributions on several topics, such as (but not limited to): Knowledge Representation and Extraction of moral, cultural and social values; Grounded World Models, with a particular focus on Ethics and Morality; Morally Informed Decision Making; Generative models of moral behavior; Formal Representation of Socio-behavioral theories for Social and Legal Norms, etc.
          In addition, it includes the exploitation of recent technologies, e.g. LLM(s), in the context of semantic technologies, to tackle the diverse challenges associated
          with moral reasoning. <br />
          <br />
          We welcome presentations that not only focus on technological
          endeavours but also explore the analysis of values and ethical issues from the perspective of philosophical, historical, social, and
          other research questions. Apart from research, resource and
          work-in-progress papers, we encourage the audience to submit position papers. 
          This interactive environment will foster a dynamic and interactive space for knowledge
          exchange and collaboration.
